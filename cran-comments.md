This is a minor update. In this version, I fixed some issues and included an internal dataset to speed up the package's main function, get_gender.

## Test environments
* Windows 10 (personal computer), R 3.4.4 
* Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4
* Windows server 2012 R2 x64 (on appveyor), 3.5.0 RC
* Win-builder (release and devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* There is just this usual note on win-builder that says "checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: ...".

## Reverse dependencies

There are no reverse dependencies.
