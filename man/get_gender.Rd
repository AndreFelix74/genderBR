\title{Predict gender from Brazilian first names}
\usage{
get_gender(names, state = NULL, prob = FALSE, threshold = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{A string specifying a person's first name. The name can also be passed to the function
as a full name (e.g., Ana Maria de Souza). \code{get_gender} is case insensitive.}

\item{state}{A string with the state of federation abbreviation (e.g., \code{RJ} for Rio de Janeiro).}

\item{prob}{Report the result as the probability of a given name be from a female person?
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric indicating the threshold used in predictions. Defaults to 0.9.}
}
\value{
\code{get_gender} may returns three different values: \code{Female}, if the name provided is from a female person;
\code{Male}, if the name provided is from a male person; or \code{NA}, if the probability of the name
provided be from a female or male person can not be infered given the chosen threshold.

If the \code{prob} argument is set to \code{TRUE}, then the function returns the proportion of females with
the provided name.
}
\description{
\code{get_gender} retrieves data on the number of male and female persons with a given first name
in Brazil to predict the most likely gender
}
\details{
Information on the gender associated with Brazilian first names was collect in the 2010 Census
(Censo Demografico de 2010, in Portuguese), in July of that year, by the Instituto Brasileiro de Demografia
e Estatistica (IBGE). The surveyed population includes 190,8 million Brazilians living in all 27 states.
According to the IBGE, there are more than 130,000 unique first names in this population.
}
\note{
Names with different spell (e.g., Ana and Anna, or Marcos and Markos) are considered different names.
Additionally, only names with more than 20 occurrences, or more than 15 occurrences in a given state,
are considered.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Use get_gender to predict the gender
# of a person based on her/his first name
get_gender('mario')

# The function accepts full names
get_gender('Maria da Silva Santos')

# Or names in uppercase
get_gender('MARIA DA SILVA SANTOS')

# It is possible to filter results by state
get_gender('ana', state = 'sp')

# To change the employed threshold
get_gender('ariel', threshold = '0.8')

# Or to get the proportion of females
# with the name provided
get_gender('iris', prob = TRUE)
}
